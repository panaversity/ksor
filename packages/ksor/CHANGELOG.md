## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 54a8f5f: `ksor init` is implemented — the first working verb. One command emits a
  complete governed knowledge project: the record (`knowledge/`), a working
  Fumadocs site (`system/site/`, static export, hot reload, static search,
  llms.txt), the agent kit (AGENTS.md constitution, CLAUDE.md pointer,
  `.agents/skills` with byte-identical `.claude/skills` copies, Gemini
  pointer), adopter CI, and a dependency-free format checker (`pnpm check`).
  Deterministic (every emitted byte ships as template content, lockfile
  included), atomic, offline. Refusals carry stable slugs with working
  remedies; environment failures exit 3 with slugs, never raw stack traces.

  The scaffold ships branded and self-explaining: the KSoR mark as the
  default favicon, a real landing page led by the instance name with the
  first document derived (never hardcoded), a deletable "Built with KSoR"
  maker's mark, a README that explains every emitted file, and a governed
  `order:` frontmatter key that drives the sidebar, `llms.txt`, and the
  home page from one declaration. The site shell is replaceable behind a
  four-clause surface contract, proven by a second (Docusaurus) shell and
  a shell-agnostic conformance suite in the ksor repository.

### Patch Changes

- 98aae4a: Rebuilt the package on the real toolchain: the CLI is now compiled TypeScript
  (pure ESM, Node >= 24) instead of a hand-written script, and it exports the CLI
  contract — `exitCodes` (1 refused, 2 not implemented, 3 environment), `verbs`,
  and `resolveCommand` — so scripts and agents can rely on documented exit
  semantics. `ksor --help`/`-h` and `--version` now answer with exit 0; every designed
  verb still answers honestly that it is not implemented and exits 2, and an
  unknown word is refused with exit 1 and a stable `error: unknown-verb` slug. Documentation now ships inside the
  package under `docs/`.

## 0.0.0

Name reservation (published 2026-08-11). The package holds the scope, states
the intent, and ships an honest placeholder CLI: any invocation prints the
reservation notice and exits `2`. Nothing in this version is a released
capability.
