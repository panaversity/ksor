### Patch Changes

- 8e88899: The scaffold now answers Vercel's deploy interview: a shipped
  `vercel.json` declares the repo root as the deploy directory (pinning
  `system/site` omits the record — the interview's natural answer breaks
  the build), the static export as the deliverable, and matching trailing
  slashes. The README gains a Deploying section documenting what was
  always true but never written down: the built site is a folder of files
  with zero host-specific dependencies — Vercel, GitHub Pages, nginx, or
  `python3 -m http.server` all serve it, with `KSOR_BASE_PATH` for
  sub-path hosts.
- 113fddd: The record can now declare its audience. A governed `visibility:` key
  (one value, orthogonal to `status:`) against an `audiences:` model in
  instance.md; per-audience **staged** builds enforce it — a build below a
  document's tier carries no trace of it: no page, no search entry, no
  llms.txt line, no sidebar title, no asset bytes, and nothing about the
  filter itself in the client bundle. Non-public builds name themselves.
  Seven checker rules guard the model, including the cross-audience link
  no single build can catch. Absent `audiences:`, nothing changes —
  purely additive. Evidence and the measured build-time-vs-per-request
  decision: the ksor repository's research/visibility.md and issue #10.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 54a8f5f: `ksor init` is implemented — the first working verb. One command emits a
  complete governed knowledge project: the record (`knowledge/`), a working
  Fumadocs site (`system/site/`, static export, hot reload, static search,
  llms.txt), the agent kit (AGENTS.md constitution, CLAUDE.md pointer,
  `.agents/skills` with byte-identical `.claude/skills` copies, Gemini
  pointer), adopter CI, and a dependency-free format checker (`pnpm check`).
  Deterministic (every emitted byte ships as template content, lockfile
  included), atomic, offline. Refusals carry stable slugs with working
  remedies; environment failures exit 3 with slugs, never raw stack traces.

  The scaffold ships branded and self-explaining: the KSoR mark as the
  default favicon, a real landing page led by the instance name with the
  first document derived (never hardcoded), a deletable "Built with KSoR"
  maker's mark, a README that explains every emitted file, and a governed
  `order:` frontmatter key that drives the sidebar, `llms.txt`, and the
  home page from one declaration. The site shell is replaceable behind a
  four-clause surface contract, proven by a second (Docusaurus) shell and
  a shell-agnostic conformance suite in the ksor repository.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 98aae4a: Rebuilt the package on the real toolchain: the CLI is now compiled TypeScript
  (pure ESM, Node >= 24) instead of a hand-written script, and it exports the CLI
  contract — `exitCodes` (1 refused, 2 not implemented, 3 environment), `verbs`,
  and `resolveCommand` — so scripts and agents can rely on documented exit
  semantics. `ksor --help`/`-h` and `--version` now answer with exit 0; every designed
  verb still answers honestly that it is not implemented and exits 2, and an
  unknown word is refused with exit 1 and a stable `error: unknown-verb` slug. Documentation now ships inside the
  package under `docs/`.

## 0.0.0

Name reservation (published 2026-08-11). The package holds the scope, states
the intent, and ships an honest placeholder CLI: any invocation prints the
reservation notice and exits `2`. Nothing in this version is a released
capability.
